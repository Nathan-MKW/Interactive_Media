		1. I always worry if I am imposing my own design aesthetic on someone else, I will question if I don't like something because it isn't my preferred design aesthetic or if they are reasonable and helpful critiques. I also find that if I am showcasing a piece I am unhappy with, I tend to become embarrassed of even presenting it to the class and will not have much to say on the piece. because of this, I have very little to say about my piece and spend the critique critiquing it myself so others know I am not happy with it, as a way to show that I can do better. I know these critiques are also important as they are learning experiences and I agree with the author that a crit is about the piece and not the person.

		<br>

		2. I do not take critiques to heart and I feel I am quite good at taking them. If there is a critique I do not agree with I will explain my reasoning for doing what I did but also acknowledge that their critique is helpful and apply it in a way that I feel is more appropriate. I tend to mainly focus on critiques that I agree with, for example, someone telling me to resize something to make the space flow better is something I will pay more attention to than someone telling me to change my colour palette to something they like more just because they like it. In addition, I feel as if I appreciate all critiques and have very rarely had a critique that I disagree with as I am the most critical of my own work and am always looking at ways in which it could improve.  

		<br>

		3. It is important to grow as an artist and a designer. we tend to be hyperfocused on what we are doing and can easily overlook aspects that can improve our work. it also allows for us to not stay in a bubble of what we like and hear from other people who may have a completely different aesthetic than our own and can incorporate to push our own work even further. As well, I find it very helpful to allow me to see other people's works and how they interpreted an assignment or how they worked through an issue I may have had. I feel listening to others' critiques can be just as valuable as listening to your own. I also feel hearing what others like about a piece can be interesting as sometimes it can be an aspect you didn't think anyone would care about and you can work on either fixing it or incorporating more of it in the future. </p>

		<p> 1. I believe that the internet has more of an ability to evolve and grow through Skeuo than with Flat. if you look at most digital design, for example CGI or game development, the ability to create Skeuo imagery is becoming more and more important. this is not to say that Flat is not also important with these design processes and have there place and time, I just believe that we have explored flat design and I personally find Skeuo more interesting and the capabilities of computers allowing for more accurate representation to be more of an interesting evolution than that of flat.

		<br>

		2. Zoopraxiscope is a "animation" created through the use of light and a multitude of images made in a way that there is very little difference between them so when there is movement they look as if they are in motion. This relates to web and web design as it is a way to display visual language to multiple people at once, much like what the web does on day to day activities. In addition, the author describes their relation and similarities to GIFs, an important aspect of the modern digital age. The author then discusses how these zoopraxiscope's lead towards the glow of screens, how screens work can be seen as a more evolved version of the zoopraxiscope. They also note that this can make web design seem as "children" of film and not just graphic design. 

		 <br>

		3.  I agree that screens want "flux". In the reading, flux is described as a variety of design tools used to engaged and display information in an interactive and informative way. An example of flux, in the reading, was describing how designers will design websites to have different functionalities for later at night to allow for a different experience depending on the time. this is an important way to create accessible design for a group of people and is important when creating a website meant for user interactions. In this way yes, I believe screens want flux. In fact, I believe that screens need flux to function on a not only aesthetically pleasing frame of form but also to allow for the user experience and the information to be available for an abundance of people no matter the language or digital abilities.</p>

		<p>1. Lialiana believes that the word "user" is multifaceted with many meanings. Depending on the context and what form of user experience being discussed, the user has many different meanings. She does not believe that a user should not understand computers and believes that the term user should have an understanding of how computers work. She does not appear to dislike the term user but disapproves of many f the connotations that go with it, for example, them not understanding how computers work, as stated above, and use the programming as well as the computer itself as an extension of whatever they are doing. This is the majority of what I have taken away from her text and discussion on why she agreed or disagreed with different user experience authors from a combination of different works.  she believes that with what users are already able to do today, it wouldn't be difficult to separate the umbrella "user" term into a few different types of users with different capabilities. 

		<br>

		2. Lialiana says that the user is imagined, something that is reimagined over and over. She believed that users are not stupid but busy with something other than the interface they are using. She also believes that the use of digital media is important for their final product. this can be seen when she discusses her qualms with how adobe portrays "fewer clicks" as something that helps with creativity while she believes that the process of using software is what helps a user. in addition, she discusses how users should have an understanding of how computers work and should not be considered dumb in terms of their capabilities. As well, they should not be a singularity, they should have a multitude of capabilities from, of course, their knowledge of the computer, but also be able to do multiple things at once. 

		<br>

		3.  I personally do not spend too much time on many websites and am mainly on things that are "seamless" in their experience however I do remember when I was younger and would play flash games with my brothers. games intrinsically will have the user fill gaps as they have to move an item from one place to the other or push certain buttons etc. however, there are specific games I remember where the creator was too lazy to put music in and would tell us to type the song into youtube and play it so we can have music. Gaps to be filled in do not have to be that obvious however, from what was discussed in the writing, most websites have some kind of gap that the user is needed to fill in in one way or another and that is what makes the internet and websites themselves, some more than others, feel more personable in some way.</p>

		<p>1. I agree with Schwulst's advocacy for individual websites over social media as she is correct, social media is not for the users but instead for advertisements. this is easily seen with how little privacy users of apps such as Instagram or TikTok really have along with issues of people not disclosing sponsored content. I believe that if people truly want an individualized system of expression for the individual creating the website. This meaning that while on apps like Facebook or Instagram the format for posting and visual information tends to not allow for much leeway in the expression of visual information and personal preference. Instagram only allows for pictures to be of certain sizes and videos to be a certain length while if one creates their own website they have full creative control in how they wish to display any sort of information whether it is visual information or written. It also would allow for the creator to have full control over what they feel is appropriate to post online and what is not.

		<p>1. I believe Mindy Seu's opening statement about 'defamiliarizing our tools' stems from looking at how we interact with the web through a different lens. In this, mainly looking at how we can be more invested in how we use functions of the digital age to make them less of an automated usage. Seu states that we should identify these tool constraints and how these can be used in new ways to create a more energetic and exciting digital future. I believe this relates to the use of the word poetry as its relation to a human conscious. she wants more people to look at and use the internet in a more conscious manner, much like how people react to poetry while listening or reading. 'poems' in a digital sense tend to relate more to digital media that connects to individuals consciousness whether it be visually or logistically.

		2. The website I have chosen: 
		 <a href="https://pushing-tables.glitch.me/">Sunday Sites</a>

		 <br>

		This website reminds me of the sweetheart's website, in both the color palette but also the visuals. it may not be an animated website but it is a kinetic website using the hover function to create an interactive experience with imagery that pops up so quickly it is almost shocking. the creator of this website has made the function be able to be looked at whether from left to right or top to bottom creating an experience that one can search through any way they want. with a sentence scattered throughout the squares. the website almost resembles a modernist painting in the images popping up and the original landing page. I feel this resembles removing the function from the form as the whole point of the webpage is to show a single line while showing disorienting imagery in the midst of the viewers search for the sentence. </p>
