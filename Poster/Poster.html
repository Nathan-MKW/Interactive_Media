						Theorizing the Web is an 
						inter- and non-disciplinary annual 
						conference that brings together scholars, journalists, artists, 
						activists, and technology practitioners to think conceptually 
						and critically about the interrelationships between the Web 
						and society. We deeply value public engagement, and consider 
						insights from academics, non-academics, and 
					non-“tech theorists” alike to be equally valuable.</p>

				<h1>Morning Program</h1>
				<h4>Friday April, 27</h4>
				<h5>10:30AM Doors Open
				Noon–1:15pm Session 1</h5>
				<h5>Studio A #A1 Body Politics</h5>
				<div class="content">
					<p>Moderator: Whitney Erin Boesel
						From intimate depictions of bodies to substantial changes to the body itself, 
						digitality permeates us.
					</p>			
				</div>
				<h5>Studio B #B1 Tech Support</h5>
				<div class="content">
					<p>Moderator: Michael Connor

						To sustain protest we must also turn to oneanother for support. Can digital media 
						serve as ameans for this without undermining it?
					</p>
				</div>
				<h5>Studio C #C1 May Quest</h5>
				<div class="content">
					<p>Moderator: Jeremy Antley
						Digitality hasn’t obviated geography as was anticipated; it has made geopolitical 
						boundaries simultaneously more visible and more intensely monitored. Sometimes 
					technology even makes visible border practices that states intend to be invisible.</p>
