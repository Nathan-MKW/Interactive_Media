		<h3>I see the web as a form of depth, something that people look at with awe in its magnitude as well as with fear of its contents. The depiction of the web I have is that of the ocean as there is a magnitude of information that can be depicted and displayed that it is impossible for people to have seen everything available to them online. an individual website helps create an ecosystem of websites with links to each other and a connection in key search terms. creating an independent website is adding to this ecosystem and it can either be a positive addition or a negative addition, with some more popular than others.Â </h3>
